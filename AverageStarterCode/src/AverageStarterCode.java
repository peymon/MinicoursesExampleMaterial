*   This code provides the starting structure for the following exercise:
*
*   Using the String array 'someWords', complete the main method so that it
*   computes and prints the AVERAGE LENGTH of the words in the array.
*
*   Remember:
*   You can use .length on an array variable (myArray.length) to get its length,
*   You can use .length() on a String variable (myString.length()) to get its
*   length.
