## Variables, arrays and loops I

### A - Creating and manipulating variables

#### Short questions

Determine if each of the following is true or false, and in either case, explain your reasoning.

F `int` is a __reference__ variable type.
F You can use the - operator (subtraction) on a String to achieve __concatenation__.
T Primitive types are __numerical__ types.
F A __method__ is the top-level container of our code.
T A __class__ must always have the same name as the file it is in.

#### Code analysis questions

Errors are present in the following snippet of code. Find, identify and correct those errors. Make sure to be able to justify why they are errors.

```java
public class HelloClass {

  public void main(String[] arg) {
    INT a = 1 //missing ; //INT should be int
    double b = 2; //used for decimals.. still not incorrect.
    
    System.out.println('a + b = ' + (a + b)); //use â€œ
    
    String = "Hello, World"; //missing name. should be helloworld
    System.out.println(helloWorld);
  }
} //closing bracket
```

#### Programming questions

__Problem 1__

Put together a short program that will calculate the tax on the price of three items part of a single purchase, respectively priced at 15$, 10$ and 19$, given that the tax rate is 15%. You can start using the stub below if you aren't sure of how to start off. The output of your program should be printed nicely and as a full sentence.

```java
public class taxCalculations {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    double price1 = 15;
    double price2 = 10;
    double price3 = 19;
    
    //Your code starts here!
  }
}
```

### B - Creating and manipulating arrays

#### Short questions

Determine if each of the following is true or false, and in either case, explain your reasoning.

- An array's length can be changed without recreating a new array.
- The __square bracket notation__ can be used to __access__ data from an array, but not to __modify it__.
- The __indexing system__ used by arrays has the first element be at position 0 and the last, at position (length - 2).
- You can store elements of different types inside of an array.
- The correct way to declare an empty array of `int` and length 5 is `int[] myArray = int[5];`.

#### Code analysis questions

Given the following snippet of code:
```java
char[] myCharacters = {'a','b','c','d'};
int[] myNumbers = new int[10];
```

What is the content of each array after the following statements are executed?

- `System.out.println(myCharacters[0]);`
- `myNumbers[5] = myCharacters[0];`
- `myNumbers[0] = myNumbers.length;`
- `myCharacters[0] = myCharacters[1]`
- `myCharacters = new char[10];`

#### Programming questions

Starting from the code snippet below, build a program that will convert the temperatures given in the `celsius` array into Kelvin and Fahrenheit degrees. Make sure to store your results in arrays as well. The position of an element in the `celsius` array should match the position of its equivalents in the other arrays.

```java
public class myTemperatureArrays {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    double[] celsius = {26.5, 10.0, 0.0, 65};
    
    //Your code should start here!
  }
}
```
